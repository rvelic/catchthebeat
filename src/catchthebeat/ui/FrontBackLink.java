/**
 * Class FrontBackLink
 * 
 * This class serves as a middleman between the Frontend (keyboard listener,
 * sound effects player, graphical user interface, threading) and the
 * Backend (game logic and state) part of the application as these need to
 * communicate with each other on many occasions.
 * 
 * It also connects the Frontend components together to provide a coherent UI experience
 * (e.g. when player hits a key, the appropriate drum is animated, sound is played
 * and the beat sequence panel updated - note all of these actions are part of
 * Frontend). 
 * 
 * The connected elements are: 
 * game logic and state (Game), 
 * panel with animated drums (PlayerPanel),
 * panel with beat sequence (GamePlayPanel),
 * sound effects player (SoundEffect),
 * and the class itself handles actions triggered by keypress (implements KeyListener, which is added to GUI).
