/**
 * Class Game
 * 
 * This is the base class for the game backend 
 * including game model (logic) and current game state,
 * excluding any UI (graphics, animation, sound, key listener) and threading.
 * 
 * The class holds information about state, i.e.
 * 1) Current game settings (difficulty, tempo, number of players).
 * 2) Player data (number of players, who is still in the game and who is currently playing).
 * 3) Beat sequence data and player's current position in the sequence
 *   (+ information about the beat sequence at tick-time).
 * 4) Round data (what is the result of current round).
 * 5) Game score data.
 * 
 * The class communicates with the frontend via FrontBackLink class.
 * 
 * This class is abstract as there are 2 game modes that incorporate slightly
 * different rules.
